# On first import, load all the classes that we have, based on the files in
# this directory.  Every file should be named after the type of task (psf,
# frame, etc), and every file should define a class named "TaskBlah" where
# "Blah" can be whatever string you want.

# We could use class (rather than instance) methods in all these task classes
# (since we generally only have one instance in this dictionary below).
# However, by using instances here we leave open the possibility to pass in
# configuration information in the constructors in the future.
